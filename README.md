**Project 2 Full Stack app - Social app**

**Description:**

This customized social media platform aims to promote freedom and privacy open to all users around the world while eliminating restrictions featured in some social apps, e.g. the need to upload a media file to make a post and real-name policy. Each post comes with the author's current country location for a sense of globalization. Bad words in the comments will be sanitized to ensure harmonious community.


**Technologies:**

Javascript, React.js, React-Bootstrap, Google Firebase, Google Maps API, Axios


**Why Fakebook?**

No worries of social media app tracking your activities/ reading your minds

No collection of data except for email

File upload is optional

Flexibility to allow/ block request to access your location (compulsory & thus a controversial feat in XiaoHongShu) - tracks & store only country name by Google Maps API in db

No unnecessary features


**Learning Points**
The need to separate frontend (repo) from backend (repo)

Importance of initial planning, routing, & structuring db

Use File Reader & file signature to check file types

Reverse geocoding with Google Maps API

Use of useParams hook to route to each post

Use of NPM packages 

Deal with async nature of Firebase - store data in state & update the state with useState for immediate re-render
